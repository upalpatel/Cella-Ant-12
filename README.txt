	which every cell of the grid has a color. For this program all the cells are black.
	As the ant moves the its direction and color on the cell change simultaneously.
	For Ant #12, 12 decimal in binary are 1100, 1 for left and 0 for right.
	As each cell has 4 states, each state on the grid has a color associated with it
	from low to high bit: black=0->red=1->yellow->2->blue=3. 
	The ant turns right on black and red and left on yellow and blue.
